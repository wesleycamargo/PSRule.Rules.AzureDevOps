## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Export of **Organization Settings** in `Export-AzDevOpsOrganizationRuleData` to extend coverage of organizational rule data.

### Improved

- Enhanced error handling to allow the export process to continue even if individual export steps fail.
- Logging messages now provide clearer and more structured feedback during execution.

### Fixed

- Required repository policies must be enabled, blocking, correctly scoped, and configured for the claimed control. Exact and prefix branch scopes are matched within the same scope entry, including all-repository policies.
- Project, pipeline, branch, policy, group, environment, variable-group, and release-definition discovery follows continuation headers and rejects failed or malformed pages.
- Repository file checks distinguish confirmed missing files and empty repositories from unavailable evidence.
- Organization exports collect organization settings once, even without projects, and report their completeness separately. Organization collectors use refreshed authentication.
- Managed identity expiry uses UTC; failed connection verification preserves the existing connection.
- Production-only environment and service-connection checks use the existing production selector.
- Secret detection no longer treats arbitrary 32/40-character strings or unsigned legacy PAT lengths as proof of a secret; structured detections use sanitized reasons and recognize signed Azure DevOps PATs.
- CI shares the pinned offline runner, covers source/manifests/pipelines/workflows, explicitly propagates test failures, and retains diagnostics. Gallery publishing validates an explicit manual version tag before optional publication.

- `Export-AzDevOpsRuleData` no longer requires `-Organization` and `-OrganizationId`; both default to the connection, and an explicit `-OrganizationId` is now used instead of being discarded.
- `Connect-AzDevOps -AccessToken` no longer requires `-OrganizationId`.
- The organization readers (`Read-AdoOrganizationPipelinesSettings`, `-GeneralOverview`, `-SecurityPolicies`, `-GeneralBillingSettings`) accept a bare access token as well as a full `Bearer` header value.
- `Get-AzDevOpsPipelineYaml` throws on authentication failures instead of returning nothing, and no longer returns an HTML sign-in page as pipeline YAML.
- `Export-AdoOrganizationPipelinesSettings` uses the same "not connected" message as the other collectors.
- The `Baseline.PublicProject` baseline also excludes `Azure.DevOps.Organization.Pipelines.Settings.DisableAnonymousBadgeAccess`.

### Testing

- `tests/Run-Tests.ps1` selects `Unit`, `Integration`, or `Authentication` tests and fills missing `ADO_*` variables from the Azure CLI login for live runs.
- Live authentication tests moved to `tests/Authentication.Tests.ps1`.
- `tests/Initialize-IntegrationTestData.ps1` creates the Azure DevOps test data the Integration tests expect.
- The dev container image installs the pinned Pester and PSRule versions, and `.vscode/launch.json` has one entry per test type.
