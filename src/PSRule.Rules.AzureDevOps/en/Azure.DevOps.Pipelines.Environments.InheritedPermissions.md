# Azure.DevOps.Pipelines.Environments.InheritedPermissions

## SYNOPSIS

Effective sensitive permissions must be authorized by organizational policy.

## DESCRIPTION

The historical rule ID is retained, but inheritance alone is no longer a failure. The rule evaluates the ordered ACL path, nested group membership, explicit allow and deny, and administrative bypass in `PermissionEvidence`. Configure `effectivePermissionPolicies` for target type `Azure.DevOps.Pipelines.Environment` with a policy reference, security namespace, sensitive permission mask, and allowed descriptor-to-mask map. Missing policy, ACL ancestry, identity resolution, or administrator evidence is Unknown in assessment output and not evaluated by PSRule. It never becomes a pass. Read-only inherited access is allowed; unauthorized sensitive rights fail.

## RECOMMENDATION

Collect complete permission evidence and restrict unauthorized privileges. Keep legitimate least-privilege inheritance. See [permission evidence](../../../docs/assessment/permission-evidence.md) for collection and policy configuration.

## ASSESSMENT

Independent assessment risk: **Medium** (severity policy `1.1.0`). The legacy help severity above and PSRule level Warning remain compatibility metadata; they are not the four-grade assessment scale.
