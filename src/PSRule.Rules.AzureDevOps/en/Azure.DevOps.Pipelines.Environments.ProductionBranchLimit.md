# Azure.DevOps.Pipelines.Environments.ProductionBranchLimit

## SYNOPSIS

A production environment should be limited to the branches it can be used in.

## DESCRIPTION

This production-only rule uses the `IsProduction` name selector. Development resources are skipped. Name matching is a convention; configure names or suppressions to match your production inventory.

A production environment should be limited to the branches it can be used in. This ensures
the environment is not used in a non-production branch. This rule checks if the
environment is limited to a production branch.

Mininum TokenType: `FineGrained`

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider limiting the environment to a production branch.
