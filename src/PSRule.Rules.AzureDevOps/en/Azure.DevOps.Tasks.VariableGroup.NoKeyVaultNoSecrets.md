# Azure.DevOps.Tasks.VariableGroup.NoKeyVaultNoSecrets

## SYNOPSIS

Variable groups should not expose credentials.

## DESCRIPTION

This rule ID is deprecated and retained as an alias of `Azure.DevOps.Tasks.VariableGroup.NoPlainTextSecrets`. Both diagnostics map to the same secret-exposure risk group. Masked Azure DevOps secret variables (`isSecret: true`, `value: null`) are accepted without a Key Vault requirement. Unmasked declared secrets and values matching credential patterns fail. Pattern detection cannot prove that arbitrary plaintext is not a secret. Missing variable collection is Unknown in assessment output and not evaluated by PSRule; it is never a pass.

Minimum TokenType: `ReadOnly`

## RECOMMENDATION

Use masked Azure DevOps secret variables or Key Vault references. Rotate exposed credentials. Restore collection permissions when evidence is unavailable.

## ASSESSMENT

Independent assessment risk: **Medium** (severity policy `1.1.0`). The legacy help severity above and PSRule level Error remain compatibility metadata; they are not the four-grade assessment scale.
