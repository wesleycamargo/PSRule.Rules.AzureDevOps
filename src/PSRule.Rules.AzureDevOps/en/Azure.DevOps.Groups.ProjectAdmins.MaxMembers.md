# Azure.DevOps.Groups.ProjectAdmins.MinMembers

## SYNOPSIS

The project administrators group should have at most 4 members.

## DESCRIPTION

The project administrators group should have at most 4 members. This ensures that there is not too many people who can manage the project. This rule applies to the default project administrators group.

Mininum TokenType: `ReadOnly`

This setting is configurable and can be changed to suit your organization's needs with `ProjectAdminsMaxMembers` in the `configuration` section of your ps-rule.yaml file.

## RECOMMENDATION

Consider removing members from the project administrators group.

## ASSESSMENT

Independent assessment risk: **Medium** (severity policy `1.1.0`). The legacy help severity above and PSRule level Warning remain compatibility metadata; they are not the four-grade assessment scale.

Set `ProjectAdminsMaxMembers` to the approved administrative operating-model threshold, for example 5 for five justified administrators. Retain the access-review policy reference in assessment configuration; count alone does not establish privilege quality.
